🎯 Java Mini Projects

This repository contains five beginner-friendly Java console applications for practicing object-oriented programming, logic building, and user interaction.

🧠 TASK 1: Number Guessing Game

A simple game where:

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

After each guess, the program provides hints ("Too high" or "Too low").

The game supports multiple rounds and tracks the score based on rounds won.

Features:

Random number generation.

Input validation.

Score tracking.

Replay option.

📝 TASK 2: Student Grade Calculator

A console application that:

Takes marks (out of 100) for multiple subjects as input.

Calculates the total marks and average percentage.

Assigns a grade based on the average.

Grading Criteria Example:

A: 90% and above

B: 80% - 89%

C: 70% - 79%

D: 60% - 69%

F: Below 60%

Features:

Accepts subject-wise marks.

Computes total, percentage, and grade.

Displays results in a clear format.

🏦 TASK 3: ATM Interface

A simulated ATM system with the following functionality:

Users can check their balance, deposit funds, or withdraw money.

Proper checks are in place to prevent overdrawing.

Classes:

ATM: Handles operations like withdraw, deposit, and check balance.

BankAccount: Manages the user's balance.

Features:

Object-oriented structure.

Input validation (e.g., checking for sufficient funds).

Clear transaction messages.

💱 TASK 4: Currency Converter

A basic currency converter application:

User selects base and target currencies.

Enters the amount to convert.

The program converts it using predefined exchange rates.

Note: This version uses hardcoded exchange rates. (Real-time API integration can be added in future versions.)

Features:

Currency conversion between major currencies.

Simple user interface via console.

Accurate and formatted result display.

🎓 TASK 5: Student Management System

A console-based student record manager with features like:

Adding new students

Editing existing student data

Searching by roll number or name

Displaying all student records

Deleting student records

Classes:

Student: Contains student details.

StudentManagementSystem: Manages all operations on student data.

Features:

File-based storage (optional for persistence).

Input validation.

Modular design for scalability.
